Introduction:

Employee retention is critical for companies to maintain a stable workforce and reduce the costs associated with hiring and training new employees. This project involves building a predictive model to determine whether an employee is likely to stay or leave the company, based on various features.

Dataset:

The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle: Employee Retention Dataset.

The dataset contains information such as:

Satisfaction Level
Last Evaluation
Number of Projects
Average Monthly Hours
Time Spent at the Company
Work Accident
Promotion in Last 5 Years
Department
Salary
Employee Retention (target variable)

Modeling Process:

The process involves the following steps:

Data Cleaning: 

Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and encoding categorical features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Understanding the data through visualizations and statistical analysis.

Feature Engineering: 

Creating new features and selecting the most relevant ones for the model.

Model Selection: 

Decision Trees model is used to classify the rentention.

Model Evaluation: Using metrics such as score to evaluate model performance.

Results:

The performance of the best model is evaluated and the key findings are summarized in this section. Some possible outcomes might include:

Importance of different features in predicting employee retention.

Model accuracy and other relevant metrics.

Insights into employee behavior and retention patterns.
